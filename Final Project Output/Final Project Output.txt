Final Project Output - AdventureWorksLT2017:


	Provides an end-to-end summary of the Azure-based Data Engineering Pipeline for the AdventureWorksLT2017 dataset. It outlines the entire data flow, key 	transformations, and final reporting.

	1. Project Overview

		Business Problem: Transform and analyze AdventureWorksLT2017 sales data for optimized reporting.

		Solution: Implement a Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold) for efficient data ingestion, transformation, and reporting.

		Tools Used:

			Azure Services: Data Factory, Data Lake Storage Gen2, Synapse Analytics, Key Vault

			Processing: Databricks (PySpark)

			Reporting: Power BI

	2. Data Pipeline Overview

		The pipeline consists of three main layers:

			Layer			Storage Format			Purpose
			Bronze			Parquet				Stores raw ingested data from on-prem SQL Server
			Silver			Delta				Cleansed and transformed data with better business understanding
			Gold			Delta				Final fact and dimension tables for reporting (Star Schema)

	3. Data Flow


		1 Data Ingestion (Bronze Layer)

			Source: On-prem SQL Server Database (AdventureWorksLT2017)

			Process: Data Factory pulls data into Azure Data Lake Gen2.

			ADF Activities Used: Lookup, ForEach, Copy Data

			Storage Format: Parquet


		2️ Data Transformation (Silver Layer)

			Processing Engine: Databricks (PySpark)

			Key Transformations:

				Renamed columns for business clarity

				Modified date formats

				Combined columns for better insights

				Dropped unnecessary columns

				Filled missing values with "Unknown"

				Stored transformed data in Delta format


		3️ Data Modeling & Aggregation (Gold Layer)

			Star Schema implemented for analytical performance.

			Dimension Tables: DimCustomer, DimProduct

			Fact Tables: FactSales, FactSalesAggregation

			Transformations Applied:

				Joins to create denormalized tables

				Surrogate keys for dimension tables

				Data formatting & aggregations for facts

				Optimization for fast queries


		4️ Data Warehouse & Reporting

			Azure Synapse Analytics:

			Gold Layer tables are loaded into serverless SQL database (gold_db).

			Views created for Power BI consumption.

			Power BI Dashboard:

				Connected to Synapse Views

				Key Metrics: Total Sales, Top Customers, Revenue Trends

				Visualizations: Sales Trends, Product Performance, Geographic Insights

		4. Key Metrics & Performance
			
			✅ Pipeline Efficiency
	
			Incremental Load Execution: Every 8 AM Daily

			Automated Trigger: Ensures up-to-date insights



	 5. Summary & Final Output

		✅ Fully automated data pipeline from on-prem SQL Server → Azure Data Lake → Databricks → Synapse → Power BI.
		✅ Incremental loading & scheduling ensure real-time insights.
		✅ Optimized reporting with Fact-Dimension model (Star Schema).
		✅ Power BI dashboards for business decision-making.
