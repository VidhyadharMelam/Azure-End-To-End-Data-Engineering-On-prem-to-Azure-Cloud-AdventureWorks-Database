Data Transformation:

	Provides a detailed breakdown of the data transformations applied across the Bronze, Silver, and Gold Layers in the AdventureWorksLT2017 dataset.

	1Ô∏è Bronze Layer: Raw Data Ingestion

		Purpose:

			Store raw data as-is from the On-Prem SQL Server database into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2) in Parquet format.

			Maintain the original schema for data lineage and auditing.

			Transformations in Bronze Layer:

			‚úÖ No transformations applied in this layer. The data is stored in its native form to ensure immutability and traceability.

	2Ô∏è Silver Layer: Cleansed and Transformed Data

		Purpose:

			Perform initial cleaning and structuring to make the data ready for analytical consumption.

			Apply column standardization, type conversions, and enrichment for better usability.

			Store the transformed data in Delta format for faster queries and reliability.

			Transformations Applied in Silver Layer:

				1. General Data Cleaning for All Tables
				‚úÖ Drop unnecessary columns that are not required for business analysis.
				‚úÖ Rename columns for better readability and business understanding.
				‚úÖ Modify date columns to a standard format (YYYY-MM-DD).
				‚úÖ Convert data types (e.g., string to integer, integer to decimal).
				‚úÖ Handle NULL values by replacing them with "Unknown" or default values.
				‚úÖ Extract relevant columns required for further processing.


	2. Table-Specific Transformations

		‚û§ Customer Data (Silver.Customer)
			
			Remove PII data like phone numbers (if applicable).

			Standardize naming conventions for customers.

			Replace NULL values in CompanyName with "Individual".

		‚û§ Address Data (Silver.Address)

			Standardize address formatting.

			Extract city, state, and postal code into separate columns for better analysis.

			Remove duplicates.

		‚û§ Product Data (Silver.Product, Silver.ProductCategory, Silver.ProductModel)

			Categorize products by category name.

			Remove unnecessary columns such as internal system tracking fields.

			Standardize product descriptions.


		‚û§ Sales Data (Silver.SalesOrderHeader, Silver.SalesOrderDetail)

			Convert all monetary values to a consistent currency format.

			Standardize order status values.

			Extract order date, due date, and ship date from timestamp format.

	
	3Ô∏è Gold Layer: Analytical & Reporting Data

		Purpose:

			Denormalize and aggregate data for faster analytical queries.

			Create Fact and Dimension tables following the Star Schema.

			Ensure optimized storage and performance for BI reporting in Power BI.

			Transformations Applied in Gold Layer:

				1. Dimension Tables (Denormalized)
				‚û§ DimCustomer
				‚úÖ Join Silver.Customer, Silver.CustomerAddress, and Silver.Address to create a single, enriched customer table.
				‚úÖ Generate Surrogate Keys (CustomerSK) to replace the natural CustomerID for optimized joins.
				‚úÖ Format date columns to ensure consistency.
				‚úÖ Fill missing values (e.g., unknown addresses) with "Unknown".
				‚úÖ Drop unnecessary columns (e.g., technical IDs that are not needed for analysis).
				‚úÖ Standardize city and state names to ensure uniformity.


		‚û§ DimProduct

			‚úÖ Join Silver.Product, Silver.ProductCategory, and Silver.ProductModel to create a single product dimension table.
			‚úÖ Generate Surrogate Keys (ProductSK) to replace ProductID for optimized joins.
			‚úÖ Drop redundant columns that are no longer needed.
			‚úÖ Standardize category names for better reporting.
			‚úÖ Fill missing values in product descriptions with "No Description Available".

	
	2. Fact Tables (Transactional & Aggregated Data)

		‚û§ FactSales

			‚úÖ Join Silver.SalesOrderHeader and Silver.SalesOrderDetail to create a fully detailed sales transaction table.
			‚úÖ Ensure Referential Integrity by using CustomerSK and ProductSK from Dimension tables.
			‚úÖ Convert all date fields (OrderDate, DueDate, ShipDate) into standardized date formats.
			‚úÖ Standardize monetary values for revenue calculations.
			‚úÖ Drop unnecessary columns such as administrative or internal tracking fields.

		‚û§ FactSalesAggregation

			‚úÖ Load data from FactSales and aggregate sales at customer and product levels.
			‚úÖ Calculate total sales per customer and per product.
			‚úÖ Compute the total number of orders per customer and per product.
			‚úÖ Generate an "Average Sales per Order" metric for further insights.
			‚úÖ Optimize data for querying by partitioning data on OrderDate for improved performance.



üîπ Final Gold Layer Schema

Table Name		Type		Description
DimCustomer		Dimension	Enriched customer data with address details
DimProduct		Dimension	Enriched product data with category information
FactSales		Fact Table	Detailed sales transactions
FactSalesAgg		Fact Table	Aggregated sales insights for reporting


Key Takeaways:

	Bronze Layer: Raw data storage without transformations.

	Silver Layer: Initial transformations like data cleansing, formatting, and restructuring.

	Gold Layer: Denormalized and optimized data for analytical queries in Star Schema format.
